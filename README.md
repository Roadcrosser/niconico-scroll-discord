# NicoNico Discord Scrolling
Webpage for Nico-style discord message scrolling

For use with OBS.

## Usage

Rename (or copy) `config.sample.json` to `config.json`.

Run the webapp:
```
python3 app.py
```

Then visit the webpage it's hosting (usually 127.0.0.1:5000).

## FAQ

**Why not make it natively JS and run solely in the browser without a webserver?**

I tried once like last year and it never worked out. Discord.js just sucks in general I guess...
